# Graphs

A graph is a data structure designer to show relationships between objects.

A graph objects are referred to as `nodes` or `vertexes` with the lines connected them `edges`.

Edges can store data, often about the strength of a connection or distance within the graph space.

## Properties

### Directions

Edges can have a direction. This means that the relation between two nodes applies only one way (in maths speak, the relationship is not transitive).

When edges have a sense of direction the graphs is a `directed graph`.

For example a graph that represents travel plans. You must start at a node and traverse from node to node, there is a start and end node. If you do a reverse trip, you will need new edges to represent that direction.

An `undirected graph` has edges with no sense of direction. No sense of dependency.

### Cycles

A graph can have cycles. A cycle is when you can follow the edges back to a node (loop back to where you started).

Note, a `Tree graph` cannot have a cycle. It is `acyclic`.

### Connectivity

A connected graph has no disconnected vertices. A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.

In Graph Theory connectivity can be measured. The concept of connectivity is the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed for the graph to become disconnected.

For example, say the image below represents two friendship groups. If you were to remove just one connection in the left group, the graph would becomes disconnected.

## Graph representations

## OOP

Graphs can be functionally the same but built and represented in a number of different ways.

Object orientated languages might use `Vertex` and `Edge` objects to represent a graph.

```Python
class Vertex(object):
    id: str
    name: str
    edges: List[Edge]

class Edge(object):
    id: str 
    strength: int
    nodes: List[Vertex]
```

However, this can make traversing through graphs inconvenient.

### Edge List

An edge list is simply a list of edges. 

The edges are represented as a list of two elements (typically numbers that represent vertices) that have an edge between them.

### Adjacency List

In an adjacency list vertices have an ID number that corresponds to the index in an array. Node 0 is represented as `adjacent_list[0]`, Node 1 is represented as `adjacent_list[1]`

Each element of the adjacent list is used to store a list of nodes that the node of that ID is adjacent to.

In the example below

- index 0 shows that node 0 is adjacent to node 1
- index 1 shows that node 1 is adjacent to nodes 0, 2, 3
- index 2 shows that node 2 is adjacent to nodes 1, 3
- index 3 shows that node 3 is adjacent to nodes 1, 2

## Some examples

A `Tree` is a type of Graph with certain properties

> A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))]:

- G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
- G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
- G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is removed from G.
- G is connected and the 3-vertex complete graph K3 is not a minor of G.
- Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.


A `DAG` (directed acyclic graph) is another example (some Tree graphs are DAGs)

> A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.
>
> It consists of vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions.

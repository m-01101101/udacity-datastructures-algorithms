# Greedy

A greedy algorithm choses the "best" solution first, then the next best, and continues until reaching the limit.

> greedy technique, we follow the best possible solution at each step of the algorithm

The following `Knapsack problem` from MIT's "Introduction to computation and programming" provides a good illustration;

> A burglar has a knapsack that can hold at most 20 pounds of loot. They break into a house and find the following items, how do they decide what to take and what to leave behind?

|  | Value | Weight | Value/Weight |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clock | 175 | 10 | 17.5 |
| Painting | 90 | 9 | 10 |
| Radio | 20 | 4 | 5 |
| Vase | 50 | 2 | 25 |
| Book | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| Computer | 200 | 20 | 10 |

> The thief would have to decide what "best" should mean. Though greedy-by-density yields the best result in this case (start by taking the vase, then the clock, then painting, use value to break the tie when value/weight is equal) there is no guarantee that a greedy-by-density algorithm is always the best approach.

> More generally, there is no guarantee that any solution to this kind of knapsack problem that is found by a greedy algorithm will be optimal - _there is probably some deep moral lesson to be extracted "greed is not good".

> Because we are not considering future scenarios (and are only concerned with the best choice at each step), a greedy solution might not be the most effective solution for the problem.

In "algorithms to live by", the authors describe greedy algorithms as "myopic algorithms": one that short-sightedly takes the best thing available every step of the way.

### Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph;

> For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.

### Implementation

Find the shortest path to all the nodes starting from a given single source node.

1. Create a `result` dictionary. At the end of the program, `result` will have the shortest distance (value) for all nodes (key) in the graph. For our example, it will become as `{'A': 0, 'B': 5, 'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'F': 6, 'E': 4}`<br><br>
1. Start with the source node. Distance from source to source itself is 0.  <br><br>
1. The distance to all other nodes from the source is unknown initially, therefore set the initial distance to infinity.  <br><br>
1. Create a set `unvisited` containing nodes that have not been visited. Initially, it will have all nodes of the graph.<br><br>
1. Create a `path` dictionary that keeps track of the previous node (value) that can lead to the current node (key). At the end of the program, for our example, it will become as `{'B': 'A', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'A', 'F': 'C', 'E': 'C'}`. <br><br>
1. As long as `unvisited` is non-empty, repeat the following:
 - Find the unvisited node having smallest known distance from the source node.  <br><br>
 - For the current node, find all the **unvisited neighbours**. For this, you have calculate the distance of each unvisited neighbour.  <br><br>
 - If the calculated distance of the **unvisited neighbour** is less than the already known distance in `result` dictionary, update the shortest distance in the `result` dictionary. <br><br>
 - If there is an update in the `result` dictionary, you need to update the `path` dictionary as well for the same key. <br><br>
 - Remove the current node from the `unvisited` set.

**Note** - This implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm is not very efficient. Currently it has a *O(n^2)* time complexity. We will see a better version in the next lesson - "Graph Algorithms" with *O(nlogn)* time complexity.

```Python
# Helper Code
from collections import defaultdict
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = set()                   # A set cannot contain duplicate nodes
        self.neighbours = defaultdict(list)  # Defaultdict is a child class of Dictionary that provides a default value for a key that does not exists.
        self.distances = {}                  # Dictionary. An example record as ('A', 'B'): 6 shows the distance between 'A' to 'B' is 6 units

    def add_node(self, value):
        self.nodes.add(value)

    def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, distance):
        self.neighbours[from_node].append(to_node)
        self.neighbours[to_node].append(from_node)
        self.distances[(from_node, to_node)] = distance
        self.distances[(to_node, from_node)] = distance    # lets make the graph undirected / bidirectional 
        
    def print_graph(self):
        print("Set of Nodes are: ", self.nodes)
        print("Neighbours are: ", self.neighbours)
        print("Distances are: ", self.distances)

''' TO DO: Find the shortest path from the source node to every other node in the given graph '''
def dijkstra(graph, source):
    # Declare and initialize result, unvisited, and path

    # As long as unvisited is non-empty
    while unvisited: 
        
        # 1. Find the unvisited node having smallest known distance from the source node.
        
        # 2. For the current node, find all the unvisited neighbours. For this, you have calculate the distance of each unvisited neighbour.
        
        # 3. If the calculated distance of the unvisited neighbour is less than the already known distance in result dictionary, update the shortest distance in the result dictionary.        

        # 4. If there is an update in the result dictionary, you need to update the path dictionary as well for the same key.
                    
        # 5. Remove the current node from the unvisited set.

    return result

# Greedy

A greedy algorithm choses the "best" solution first, then the next best, and continues until reaching the limit.

> greedy technique, we follow the best possible solution at each step of the algorithm

The following `Knapsack problem` from MIT's "Introduction to computation and programming" provides a good illustration;

> A burglar has a knapsack that can hold at most 20 pounds of loot. They break into a house and find the following items, how do they decide what to take and what to leave behind?

|  | Value | Weight | Value/Weight |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clock | 175 | 10 | 17.5 |
| Painting | 90 | 9 | 10 |
| Radio | 20 | 4 | 5 |
| Vase | 50 | 2 | 25 |
| Book | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| Computer | 200 | 20 | 10 |

> The thief would have to decide what "best" should mean. Though greedy-by-density yields the best result in this case (start by taking the vase, then the clock, then painting, use value to break the tie when value/weight is equal) there is no guarantee that a greedy-by-density algorithm is always the best approach.
>
> More generally, there is no guarantee that any solution to this kind of knapsack problem that is found by a greedy algorithm will be optimal - _there is probably some deep moral lesson to be extracted "greed is not good".
>
> Because we are not considering future scenarios (and are only concerned with the best choice at each step), a greedy solution might not be the most effective solution for the problem.

In "algorithms to live by", the authors describe greedy algorithms as "myopic algorithms": one that short-sightedly takes the best thing available every step of the way.

### Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph;

<img src=md_refs/dijkstra-1.png>

> For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.

<img src=md_refs/dijkstra-2.png>

#### Implementation

Find the shortest path to all the nodes starting from a given single source node.

1. Create a `result` dictionary. At the end of the program, `result` will have the shortest distance (value) for all nodes (key) in the graph. For our example, it will become as `{'A': 0, 'B': 5, 'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'F': 6, 'E': 4}`<br><br>
1. Start with the source node. Distance from source to source itself is 0.  <br><br>
1. The distance to all other nodes from the source is unknown initially, therefore set the initial distance to infinity.  <br><br>
1. Create a set `unvisited` containing nodes that have not been visited. Initially, it will have all nodes of the graph.<br><br>
1. Create a `path` dictionary that keeps track of the previous node (value) that can lead to the current node (key). At the end of the program, for our example, it will become as `{'B': 'A', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'A', 'F': 'C', 'E': 'C'}`. <br><br>
1. As long as `unvisited` is non-empty, repeat the following:
 - Find the unvisited node having smallest known distance from the source node.  <br><br>
 - For the current node, find all the **unvisited neighbours**. For this, you have calculate the distance of each unvisited neighbour.  <br><br>
 - If the calculated distance of the **unvisited neighbour** is less than the already known distance in `result` dictionary, update the shortest distance in the `result` dictionary. <br><br>
 - If there is an update in the `result` dictionary, you need to update the `path` dictionary as well for the same key. <br><br>
 - Remove the current node from the `unvisited` set.

**Note** - This implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm is not very efficient. Currently it has a *O(n^2)* time complexity. We will see a better version in the next lesson - "Graph Algorithms" with *O(nlogn)* time complexity.

> In some fields, artificial intelligence in particular, Dijkstra's algorithm or a variant of it is known as uniform cost search and formulated as an instance of the more general idea of best-first search.

### Minimum Platforms

Given arrival and departure times of trains on a single day in a railway platform,**find out the minimum number of platforms required** so that no train has to wait forthe other(s) to leave. *In other words, when a train is about to arrive, at least oneplatform must be available to accommodate it.* 

You will be given arrival and departure times both in the form of a list. The size of
both the lists will be equal, with each common index representing the same train. Note:
Time `hh:mm` would be written as integer `hhmm` for e.g. `9:30` would be written as
`930`. Similarly, `13:45` would be given as `1345`

**Example:**<br>
Input:  A schedule of 6 trains:
```
arrival = [900,  940, 950,  1100, 1500, 1800]
departure = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
```
Expected output: Minimum number of platforms required = 3

#### The greedy approach

Sort the schedule, and make sure when a train arrives or depart, keep track of the required number of platforms. We will have iterator `i` and `j` traversing the arrival and departure lists respectively. At any moment, the difference `(i - j)` will provide us the required number of platforms.

At the time of either arrival or departure of a train, if `i^th` arrival is scheduled before the `j^th` departure, increment the `platform_required` and `i` as well. Otherwise, decrement `platform_required` count, and increase `j`. Keep track of the **max** value of `platform_required` ever, as the expected result.

### Minimum Operations

Starting from the number `0`, find the minimum number of operations required to reach a given positive `target number`. You can only use the following two operations:

1. Add 1
2. Double the number

For `Target = 18`,  `output = 6`, because it takes at least 6 steps shown below to reach the target

- `start = 0`
- `step 1 ==> 0 + 1 = 1`
- `step 2 ==> 1 * 2 = 2`              # or 1 + 1 = 2
- `step 3 ==> 2 * 2 = 4`
- `step 4 ==> 4 * 2 = 8`
- `step 5 ==> 8 + 1 = 9`
- `step 6 ==> 9 * 2 = 18`

```Python
def min_operations(target: int) -> int:
    """
    Return number of steps taken to reach a target number
    input: target number (as an integer)
    output: number of steps (as an integer)
    """
    num_steps = 0
    
    # start backwards from the target
    # if target is odd --> subtract 1
    # if target is even --> divide by 2
    while target != 0:
        if target % 2 == 0:
            target = target // 2

        else:
            target = target - 1
        num_steps += 1
    return num_steps

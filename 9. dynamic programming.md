# Dynamic Programming

Invented by Richard Bellman. Though he chose the word "dynamic" because it didn't mean anything.

> "The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research... I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really going mathematics... What title, what name, could I choose? It's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities."

## The Knapsack problem

We have a knapsack, with a limited weight capacity, and a choice of items. However, not all the items can fit in the knapsack. Each item has a weight and value associated with it. The goal is to optimise the total value of items in the knapsack.

__Note from MIT's computational thinking__

> Three kinds of models; optimisation, simulation and statistical models.

> - We handle these two things differently (asymmetrically)

### Approaches

(1) Brute force: try every combination and pick the best one

A brute force algorithm can be implemented using a search tree. We use depth first search to enumerate all the possibilities

<img src=md_refs/knapsack4.png>

The number of levels in the tree is determined by the number of items.

The number of nodes in a binary choice tree at level i is 2i

An easy optimisation would be to stop at the point we've hit our constraint, there's no point checking any more possibilities. But it doesn't materially change the computational complexity.

Big O is therefore 2^n+1

$$ O(2^n) $$

This is exponential, i.e. increase the number of objects to consider `n`, and increase the time to solve.

We want something in polynomial time, where `n` is multiplied by something, or has a constant number for an exponent. E.g:

$$ O(n^2) $$
$$ O(3n) $$

(2) Greedy algorithm: while the knapsack is not full -> put "best" available item in the knapsack. We need to define "best", is it the most valuable, or is it the highest in ratio of value to weight

Let's say we try to maximise value for the smallest weight possible (the ratio). Then kept adding these items together, until we had our maximum weight.

__Example__

We have a knapsack with a weight limit of 6. `w = 6`

We create an array, where the last value with represent the max value we can put in the knapsack

| Index  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

We have the following items

```Python
A(weight=2, value=6)
B(weight=5, value=4)
C(weight=9, value=5)
```

We start with `A` as it is the "best" item in terms of value to weight. We update our array;

| Index  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value  | 0 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 |

Looking at `B`, as the weight is 5, we start at index 5. The value is bigger than the current max of 6, so we update our array;

| Index  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value  | 0 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 9 | 9 |

Looking at `C`, as the weight is 4, we start at index 4. 

- The value of 5 is less than what we currently have of 6 so we make no change
- We then check the next index (5 in this case) and compare it to our value, plus the value at index one (0 + 5). Again the value of 9 is larger, so we leave as is
- We repeat this process until we get to our item's weight, plus the highest combination to reach the max weight
    In this case this is 4 (the weight of our object, and index 2). In this case the combination (6, the value at 2 + 5, the value of our object) is now greater than the current max, so we update our array

| Index  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value  | 0 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 9 | 11 |

The table allows us to store pre-computed max numbers, meaning we only have to do the work once.

$$ O(nW) $$

This is `pseudo-polynomial time`, as a true polynomial time wouldn't have a variable aside from `n`.

## Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming works by breaking a problem down into overlapping sub-problems.

You compute and save solutions to smaller problems, then you don't need to calculate them again for more complex problems.

If we had the same items,
- something appears multiple times in the list,
- or two items have the same properties
then we would have overlapping sub- problems.

We implement a "look-up" table, storing the solution to sub-problems. This is known as "memoization"

Memoization works a problem has optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems
- Optimal substructure - a globally optimal solution can be found by combing optimal solutions to local sub-problems
	- solve two problems independently of each other and combine the solutions
	- `fib(x) = fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2)`
	- merge sort exploits the fact that a list can be sorted by first sorting sublists and then merging solutions
- Overlapping sub-problems - finding an optimal solution involves solve the same problem multiple times
	- compute fib(3) many times

In the knapsack problem, we have optimal substructure, we're comparing the left and right branch. But we do not have overlapping sub-problems (each problem is different).

### Implementation

```Python
import collections

Item = collections.namedtuple('Item', ['weight', 'value'])

# Naive Approach based on Recursion
def knapsack_max_value(knapsack_max_weight, items):
    lastIndex = len(items) - 1
    return knapsack_recursive(knapsack_max_weight, items, lastIndex)


def knapsack_recursive(capacity, items, lastIndex):
    # Base case
    if (capacity <= 0) or (lastIndex<0):
        return 0
    
    # Put the item in the knapsack
    valueA = 0
    if (items[lastIndex].weight <= capacity):
        valueA = items[lastIndex].value + knapsack_recursive(capacity - items[lastIndex].weight, items, lastIndex - 1)

    
    # Do not put the item in the knapsack
    valueB = knapsack_recursive(capacity, items, lastIndex - 1)
    
    # Pick the maximum of the two results
    result = max(valueA, valueB)
    
    return result


# DP Solution
# Get the maximum total value ($) of items that can be accommodated into the given knapsack
def knapsack_max_value(knapsack_max_weight, items):
    
    # Initialize a lookup table to store the maximum value ($) 
    lookup_table = [0] * (knapsack_max_weight + 1)


    # Iterate down the given list
    for item in items:
        
        # The "capcacity" represents amount of remaining capacity (kg) of knapsack at a given moment. 
        for capacity in reversed(range(knapsack_max_weight + 1)):
            
            if item.weight <= capacity:
                lookup_table[capacity] = max(lookup_table[capacity], lookup_table[capacity - item.weight] + item.value)

    return lookup_table[-1]    
```

## Longest Common Subsequence

In text analysis,  it is often useful to compare the similarity of two texts (imagine if you were trying to determine plagiarism between a source and answer text).

> The Longest Common Subsequence is the longest sequence of letters that are *present* in both the given two strings in the same relative order.

**Example** - Consider the two input strings, `str1 = 'ABCD'` and `str2 = 'AXBXDX'`. The LCS will be `'ABD'` with the length as **3 letters**. It is because each of the letters `'A'` , `'B'`, and `'D'` are *present* in both the given two strings in the same relative order. Note that:
* An LCS need not necessarily be a contiguous substring. 
* There can be more than one LCS present in the given two strings. 
* There can be many more common subsequences present here, with smaller length. But, in this problem we are concerned with the **longest** common subsequence. 

Take
- `A = 'ABCD'`
- `B = 'BD'`

We can see that _letters_ `B` and `D` are in sequence in both the strings, therefore LCS is `'BD'`. The length of the LCS here is 2. 

### The Idea

We can calculate the LCS length by looking at relationships between *each* letter of the two strings. Let's make a matrix with the letters of first string on top and the letters of second string on the left side. Instead of a 2x4 matrix it is a 3x5

<img src=md_refs/dynamic1.png width=35% />

Start with first picking up one letter each from the given two strings, and then check if we have a common letter. Gradually, we will add up more letters from each string.

The shortest subproblem: pick the starting letter of given two strings. We'll first ask, "what is the Longest Common Subsequence between these two letters 'A' and 'B'?" **Here, the answer is zero and we fill in the corresponding grid cell with that value.**

<img src=md_refs/dynamic2.png width=35% />

Gradually, add up more letters from first string. The next question we'd ask, "what is the LCS between 'AB' and 'B'?" **Here, we have a match, and can fill in the appropriate value 1**.

<img src=md_refs/dynamic3.png width=35% />

If we continue along this row, we can actually see that B only matches this one time, and any further questions, such as — What is the LCS between 'ABCD' and 'B'? — will have that same value, 1, due to the initial B-B match.

<img src=md_refs/dynamic4.png width=35% />

Then, we move on to the second row. 'A' and 'BD' have 0 matches.

<img src=md_refs/dynamic5.png width=35% />

We have 'AB' after picking one more letter from first string and 'BD' from second string, that have a B-B match, which we've already noted in the cell above. Gradually, we will add up more letters from first string, just like we did in the previous row. Finally, we have a match at the end D-D, where we can add 1 to our current highest match (1) to get a final LCS length as 2.

<img src=md_refs/dynamic6.png width=35% />


__NOTE__ Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on the diagonal/top-left. 

The rules are as follows:
* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.
* As you traverse your string:
    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, in our case, when we found a matching B-B, we added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.
    * If there is not a match, take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.

<img src=md_refs/dynamic7.png width=35% />

* After completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS length value**.

### Implementation

```Python
def lcs(string_a, string_b):
    
    # initialize the matrix 
    lookup_table = [[0 for x in range(len(string_b) + 1)] for x in range(len(string_a) + 1)]
    
    # enumerate(str) returns a tuple containing the index and character in each iteration
    for char_a_i, char_a in enumerate(string_a):
        
        for char_b_i, char_b in enumerate(string_b):
            
            # If there is a match, 
            # fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell plus one
            if char_a == char_b:
                lookup_table[char_a_i + 1][char_b_i + 1] = lookup_table[char_a_i][char_b_i] + 1
                
            # If there is not a match, 
            # take the maximum value from either directly to the left or the top cell
            else:
                lookup_table[char_a_i + 1][char_b_i + 1] = max(
                    lookup_table[char_a_i][char_b_i + 1],
                    lookup_table[char_a_i + 1][char_b_i])

    # the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS length value.
    return lookup_table[-1][-1]
```

## Longest Palindromic Subsequence

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g., `MADAM`.

A subsequence is an ordered set of characters that need not necessarily be a contiguous substring, e.g., `ABC` is a subsequence in `AXBYC` with `length = 3`. 

Examples:

- With an input string, `MAXDYAM`, the LPS is `MADAM`, which has `length = 5`
- With an input string, `BxAoNxAoNxA`, the LPS is `ANANA`, which has `length = 5`
- With an input string, `BANANO`, the LPS is `NAN`, which has `length = 3`
- With an input string, `ABBDBCACB`, the LPS is `BCACB`, which has `length = 5`


### The idea

Compare the characters in just **one string** with itself.

For a string of length *n* characters, you can build an `n x n` matrix. The 2-D matrix will have characters of the given string on the top as well as on the left side.

The matrix will store the solution to **smaller subproblems** first, and gradually adding up more characters to the problem. In this case, **a subproblem is to find the length of the LPS, up to a certain point in the string**. 

You can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on the diagonal/bottom-left. 

- Start with an `n x n ` matrix where *n* is the number of characters in a given string. The diagonal cells should all have the value 1 for the base case, the rest can be zeros.
- As you traverse your string:
    - If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the bottom-left of that cell ***plus two***.
    - If there is not a match, take the ***maximum value*** from either directly to the left or the bottom cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.
- After completely filling the matrix, ***the top-right cell will hold the final LPS length***.

```Python
input_string = 'BANANO'

LPS subproblem matrix:
  
     B  A  N  A  N  O
B  [[1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3],
A   [0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3],
N   [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3],
A   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
N   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
O   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

LPS length:  3
```

```Python
input_string = 'TACOCAT'

LPS subproblem matrix:

     T  A  C  O  C  A  T
T  [[1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7],
A   [0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5],
C   [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3],
O   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
C   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
A   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
T   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

LPS length:  7
```

### Implementation

pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()

    n = len(input_string) 
  
    # create a lookup table to store results of subproblems 
    L = [[0 for x in range(n)] for x in range(n)] 
  
    # strings of length 1 have LPS length = 1
    for i in range(n): 
        L[i][i] = 1 
    
    # consider all substrings
    for s_size in range(2, n+1): 
        for start_idx in range(n-s_size+1): 
            end_idx = start_idx + s_size - 1
            if s_size == 2 and input_string[start_idx] == input_string[end_idx]:
                # match with a substring of length 2

    # debug line
    # pp.pprint(L)
    
    return L[0][n-1] # value in top right corner of matrix

## The Coin Change Problem

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

As an example:

- Input: `coins = [1, 2, 3]`, `amount = 6`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The output is `2` because we can use `2` coins with value `3`. That is, `6 = 3 + 3`. We could also use `3` coins with value `2` (that is, `6 = 2 + 2 + 2`), but this would use more coins—and the problem specifies we should use the smallest number of coins possible.

```Python
def coin_change_recursive(coins, amount):
    # Create a memo that will storing the fewest coins with given amount
    # that we have already calculated so that we do not have to do the
    # calculation again.
    memo = {}
    
    def return_change(remaining):
        # Base cases
        if remaining < 0:  return float('inf')
        if remaining == 0: return 0 
        
        # Check if we have already calculated
        if remaining not in memo:
            # If not previously calculated, calculate it by calling return_change with the remaining amount
            memo[remaining] = min(return_change(remaining - c) + 1 for c in coins)
        return memo[remaining]
    
    res = return_change(amount)
    
    # return -1 when no change found
    return -1 if res == float('inf') else res


def coin_change_iterative(coins, amount):
    # initiate the list with length amount + 1 and prefill with float('inf')
    res = [float('inf')]*(amount + 1)
    
    # when amount = 0, 0 number of coins will be needed for the change
    res[0] = 0
    
    i = 0
    while (i < amount):
        if res[i] != float('inf'):
            for coin in coins:
                if i <= amount - coin:
                    res[i+coin] = min(res[i] + 1, res[i+coin])
        i += 1

    if res[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    return res[amount]   
```

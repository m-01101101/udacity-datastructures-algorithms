# Dynamic Programming

Invented by Richard Bellman. Though he chose the word "dynamic" because it didn't mean anything.

> "The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research... I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really going mathematics... What title, what name, could I choose? It's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities."

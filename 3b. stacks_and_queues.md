# Stacks and Queues

Stacks are list-based data structures.

__The main idea__

Stacks are like a stack fo objects in real life. You keep putting elements on top and you have easy access to remove or inspect the element on the top.

The element at the bottom is harder to access. You must make your way through everything above it, to reach it.

The element at the bottom is the earliest thing put in the stack.

Stacks are useful when to commonly want to access the most recent element and/or want to maintain the integrity in which you added things to the list.

In a newsfeed for example, you will what the most recent element first, and provide additional elements as the user works through the feed.

Stacks are `L.I.F.O` data structure -> last in, first out

Stacks have specific terminology.

When you add to a stack you `push`, when you remove from a stack you `pop`. 

As we only look at the top element of the stack, both operations will be performed in constant time $O(1)$

Performance-wise, a proper stack implementation is expected to take $O(1)$ time for insert and delete operations.

A stack is abstract and can be implemented with other data types, it does not have to be implemented using a list.

The type of each element and how they're connected is not specified. Only the methods for adding and removing elements id specified.

You could use a LinkedList to implement a stack. Keeping track of the front or head of the list and keep adding elements on top as you go.

## Implementing a stack using an array

In both stacks and arrays, we have a collection of elements and these elements have an order to them.

However, in an array we can access any element using its index.

In order to implement a stack using an array, we can think of stacks as a container, where we can only access it from one end. Therefore we need to restrict the ways in which we can interact with the array.

Our goal will be to implement a `Stack` class that has the following behaviors:

1. `push` - adds an item to the top of the stack
2. `pop` - removes an item from the top of the stack (and returns the value of that item)
3. `size` - returns the size of the stack
4. `top` - returns the value of the item at the top of stack (without removing that item)
5. `is_empty` - returns `True` if the stack is empty and `False` otherwise

```python
<!-- no toc -->
class Stack:

    # initialise a number of attributes
    def __init__(self, initial_size = 6):
        self.arr = [None for _ in range(initial_size)]  # think of this as creating an empty container we'll put the stack in
        self.next_index = 0  # keeps track of the top of the stack
        self.num_elements = 0

    def push(self, item):

        if self.next_index == len(self.arr):
            self._handle_stack_capacity_full()  # we have the call the method on its self

        self.arr[self.next_index] = item  # assign the item to the head of the stack
        self.next_index += 1  # increment where the index where the next item will go
        self.num_elements += 1

    def _handle_stack_capacity_full(self):
        old_arr = self.arr
        self.arr = old_arr + [None for _ in range(len(old_arr))]
        # cannot do old_arr.extend([new list])

    def size(self):
        return self.num_elements

    def is_empty(self):
        return True if  self.num_elements == 0 else False
        # return self.num_elements == 0

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            self.next_index = 0  # should already be true but good practice
            return None
        self.next_index -= 1
        self.num_elements -= 1
        return self.arr[self.next_index]  # we've removed one from the index ref so it now returns last element in the array

foo = Stack()
foo.push('test')
foo.push('42')
foo.push('fish')

assert foo.arr == ['test', 42, 'fish', None, None, None]
```

Real Python on using lists to implement stacks in Python [ref](https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/#stacks-lifos)

```text
Python’s lists are implemented as dynamic arrays internally, which means they occasionally need to resize the storage space for elements stored in them when elements are added or removed. The list over-allocates its backing storage so that not every push or pop requires resizing. As a result, you get an amortised O(1) time complexity for these operations.

To get the amortised O(1) performance for inserts and deletes, new items must be added to the end of the list with the append() method and removed again from the end using pop(). For optimum performance, stacks based on Python lists should grow towards higher indexes and shrink towards lower ones.

Adding and removing from the front is much slower and takes O(n) time, as the existing elements must be shifted around to make room for the new element. This is a performance anti-pattern that you should avoid as much as possible.
```

## Implementing a stack using a linked list

Using a linked list should reduce our time complexity, because we don't need to worry about checking the empty capacity of the array that acts as a container for our stack.

With our linked list implementation, `pop` and `push` have a time complexity of $O(1)$. There's no traversal, just changing pointers.

With an array, we had to specify some initial size (in other words, we had to set aside a contiguous block of memory in advance). But with a linked list, the nodes do not need to be contiguous. They can be scattered in different locations of memory, an that works just fine. This means that with a linked list, we can simply append as many nodes as we like. Using that as the underlying data structure for our stack means that we never run out of capacity, so pushing and popping items will always have a time complexity of $O(1)$.

```python
class Node():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        # we don't need to worry about an index,
        # we reference elements through their relation with other nodes

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.num_elements = 0

    def push(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)  # create a new Node with the value passed in

        if self.head is None:  # if empty
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head  # point our new node to the head node
            self.head = new_node  # reassign the head variable of the LinkedList to the new node

        # we could add to the tail of the list
        # however, we have to traverse the whole list to get to the top of the stack
        # else:
        #     current_node = head  # set our starting point
        #     while current_node.next:  # loop through the whole list
        #         current_node = current_node.next
        #     current_node.next = new_node  # set our new node to the end

        self.num_elements += 1

    def size(self):
        return self.num_elements
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.head is None
        # self.num_elements == 0

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return None

        to_pop = self.head
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.num_elements -= 1
        return to_pop

```

Python comes with batteries included. It's easier for us to implement a stack using existing `list()` methods.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if self.size()==0:
            return None
        else:
            return self.items.pop()
```

Stacks have a wide range of uses in algorithms. For example, they’re used in language parsing as well as runtime memory management, which relies on a call stack. A short and beautiful algorithm using a stack is depth-first search (DFS) on a tree or graph data structure.

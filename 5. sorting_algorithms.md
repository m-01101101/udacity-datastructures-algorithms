# Sorting algorithms

The naive approach is to compare every element to every other element to determine if elements are in order.

Sorting algorithms can be performed "inplace", sorted within the data structure without being copied. This will use less space as the elements won't be copied, however, it is likely to be more complex in terms of computation and therefore use more time. Once again, as with search algorithms, we have the classic trade=off of space versus time.

## Bubble sort

This is the naive approach, you take an element and compare it to every element in the array, you repeat for all elements in the array.You sort at "the bottom and work your way up".

It's called "bubble sort" because in each iteration the largest element will "bubble to the top".

Each iteration requires us to make $n - 1$ comparisons, and we are required to do $n - 1$ iterations each time.

Big O:

$$(n - 1) (n - 1) = n^2 - 2n + 1$$

Big O is not exact, so we don't worry about the constants, only the exponents, as a result, we express Big O of bubble sort as: $O(n^2)$

The most common implementation of bubble sort will assume that after the first iteration the last two elements don't need to be compared, after the second iteration the last three elements don't need to be compared and so on. This saves a little time but doesn't change our overall runtime of $O(n^2)$.

Bubble sort is performed inplace, so space complexity is $O(1)$.

```Python
from typing import List, Tuple


def bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """sort array from smallest to largest"""
    n = len(arr)
    for iteration in range(n):
        for idx in range(1, n):
            element = arr[idx]
            prev = arr[idx - 1]

            if prev <= element:
                continue

            else:  # swap
                arr[idx] = prev
                arr[idx - 1] = element
    return arr
    

def bubble_sort2(arr: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """sort tuples from largest to smallest"""
    n = len(arr)
    for iteration in range(n):
        for idx in range(0, n - 1):
            element = arr[idx]
            nxt = arr[idx + 1]

            if nxt[0] < element[0] or (nxt[0] == element[0] and nxt[1] <= element[1]):
                continue

            else:  # swap
                arr[idx] = nxt
                arr[idx + 1] = element
    return arr
```

## Merge sort

Merge sort uses a "divide and conquer" approach of breaking up the array and then building it back up and sorting at each step. The algorithm divides a list into equal halves until it has two single elements and then merges the sub-lists until the entire list has been reassembled in order.

The image below shows the comparisons required to sort the arrays.

Merge sort efficiency is a product of the number of comparisons per step (as with bubble sort typically $n - 1$) multiplied by the number of steps (the steps required to breakdown the array and build it back up), the number of iterations required has an upper bound of $\log{n}$.

<img src="md_refs/mergesort3.png">

Note the table below is similar to our binary search efficiency. It's a little different as it increments after the power of two, rather than at it.

<img src="md_refs/mergesort4.png">

As a result we are doing $n$ comparisons for $\log{(n)}$ steps;

$$O(n\log{(n)})$$

Though merge sort is more efficient in terms of computation, $\log{(n)}$ will always be less than $n$, it is less efficient in terms of space complexity, as we are having to copy values into new arrays. The auxiliary space, or extra space, is equal to: $O(n)$. _Note, this assumes we discard the arrays once we're doing with them, we just need two array at every step (1) the existing array and (2) the array being used to sort._

```Python
from typing import List


def mergesort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """implementation of merge sort algorithm"""

    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    else:
        mid_point = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid_point]
        right = arr[mid_point:]

        left = mergesort(left)
        right = mergesort(right)

        return _merge(left, right)


def _merge(left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """takes two sorted lists and merges them"""
    merged = []
    left_idx = right_idx = 0

    # move through the lists until we have exhausted one
    while left_idx < len(left) and right_idx < len(right):
        if left[left_idx] > right[right_idx]:
            merged.append(right[right_idx])
            right_idx += 1
        else:
            merged.append(left[left_idx])
            left_idx += 1

    """
    Append any leftovers. Because we've broken from our while loop,
    we know at least one is empty, and the remaining:
    a) are already sorted
    b) all sort past our last element in merged
    """
    merged += left[left_idx:]
    merged += right[right_idx:]

    return merged
```

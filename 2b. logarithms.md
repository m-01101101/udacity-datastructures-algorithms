Here's what a logarithm is asking:

"What power must we raise this base to, in order to get this answer?"

$\log_{10}(100)$ means "What power must you raise 10 to in order to get 100?".

Which is 2, because $10^2 = 100$

We can use logs in algebra to bring variables down from exponents by exploiting the fact that we can simplify $log_{10}(10^2)$ What power must we raise 10 to in order to get $10^2$? That's easyâ€”it's 2.
